# Coral coverage commentary

This repository houses data and scripts from a
study analysing commentary of the increased Great Barrier Reef coral coverage
in 2022.
The accompanying study is currently being written as a manuscript, to be
submitted to a peer-reviewed journal.

For legal and ethical reasons, the original media and Twitter datasets
cannot be uploaded in full on Github.
Thus, running the scripts in this repository will return errors.
We have made these scripts available for readers interested in specifics
of our analyses or interested in replicating the analysis on a different
dataset.

The [study](/study/) directory contains the queries used to collect
then-Twitter data and the content analysis for media articles.

The [preprocesing](/preprocessing/) directory contains data wrangling scripts.

The [analysis](/analysis/) directory contains scripts for data analysis,
in particular, the topic modelling of social media data.

Lastly, figures in the associated manuscript can be reproduced with the files
available in [writeup](/writeup/).
